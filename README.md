# Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of three critical health conditions — **Kidney Disease**, **Parkinson's Disease**, and **Liver Disease** — using machine learning models trained on medical datasets. A Streamlit-based web application enables users to input clinical data and receive disease predictions in real-time.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository includes the following files:

1. **`kidney.ipynb`**  
   Preprocessing and model training for predicting chronic kidney disease.

2. **`parkinsons.ipynb`**  
   Preprocessing and model training for detecting Parkinson’s disease.

3. **`liver.ipynb`**  
   Preprocessing and model training for predicting liver disease in Indian patients.

4. **`app.py`**  
   Streamlit web application that allows users to input relevant medical data and receive predictions for all three diseases.
